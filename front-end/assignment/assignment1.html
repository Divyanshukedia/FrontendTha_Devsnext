             Dear Thomus johnson,</b></h3>
            <p><b>
            It was a pleasure meeting you at the conference last week. As we discussed, I sincerely believe
            that the widget gizmo produced by Company Name can greatly streamline your production process.
            If you are still willing, I would like to bring some of the key members of my team along with 
            me to meet with you at Company Name. We would like to give you an overview of our services and
            discuss with you the best plan to suit your needs.
            Meeting in person would allow us to fully evaluate your wants and needs. Our team is available
            to meet any time this week or next. Please let me know, at your earliest convenience, when you
            would be available.</p>
            <h3>Your sincerely,<br>
            Anchal Singh<br> </h3></b>
